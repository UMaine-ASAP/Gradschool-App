Remaining issues to be dealt with:

-When a user clicks on a higher text field, and then continues to scroll down the view, when they reach the bottom, the final box is covered, and then they have to remove the keyboard, and bring it back up. Perhaps this could be fixed by pushing the keyboard down whenever the view is scrolled?

-Updated navigation using an unwind segue. After first submit, user is allowed to continue to the next screen to view their data, even if their data is blank. This needs to be fixed (has to do with fake button).
