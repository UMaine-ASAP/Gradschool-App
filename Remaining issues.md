Remaining issues to be dealt with:

-When a user clicks on a higher text field, and then continues to scroll down the view, when they reach the bottom, the final box is covered, and then they have to remove the keyboard, and bring it back up. Perhaps this could be fixed by pushing the keyboard down whenever the view is scrolled?

-After first submit, second application doesn't get checked to be sure everything is filled in (fake button doesn't appear). However, the third time the Next button is clicked, it checks to be sure all fields are cleared (fake button appears).

-Closing keyboard after the textview has been selected causes selection box to clear
